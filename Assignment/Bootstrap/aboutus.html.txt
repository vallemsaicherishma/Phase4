        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Company</h4>
        <p>A company, abbreviated as co., is a legal entity representing an association of people, whether natural, legal or a mixture of both, with a specific objective. Company members share a common purpose and unite to achieve specific, declared goals. Companies take various forms, such as:

          voluntary associations, which may include nonprofit organizations
          business entities, whose aim is generating profit
          financial entities and banks
          programs or educational institutions.
          A company can be created as a legal person so that the company itself has limited liability as members perform or fail to discharge their duty according to the publicly declared incorporation, or published policy. When a company closes, it may need to be liquidated to avoid further legal obligations.
          
          Companies may associate and collectively register themselves as new companies; the resulting entities are often known as corporate groups.
            </p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Team</h4>
        <p>A team is a group of individuals (human or non-human) working together to achieve their goal.

          As defined by Professor Leigh Thompson of the Kellogg School of Management, "[a] team is a group of people who are interdependent with respect to information, resources, knowledge and skills and who seek to combine their efforts to achieve a common goal".[1]
          
          A group does not necessarily constitute a team. Teams normally have members with complementary skills[2] and generate synergy[3] through a coordinated effort which allows each member to maximize their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. Naresh Jain (2009) claims:
          
          Team members need to learn how to help one another, help other team members realize their true potential, and create an environment that allows everyone to go beyond their limitations.[4]
          
          While academic research on teams and teamwork has grown consistently and has shown a sharp increase over the past recent 40 years, the societal diffusion of teams and teamwork actually followed a volatile trend in the 20th century.[5] The concept was introduced into business in the late 20th century, 
          which was followed by a popularization of the concept of constructing teams. Differing opinions exist on the efficacy of this new management fad.[6] Some see "team" as a four-letter word: overused and under-useful.[7]</p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Services</h4>
        <p>A service is an "(intangible) act or use for which a consumer, firm, or government is willing to pay."[1] Examples include work done by barbers
          , doctors, lawyers, mechanics, banks, insurance companies, and so on. Public services are those that society (nation state, fiscal union or region) as a whole pays for. Using resources, 
          skill, ingenuity, and experience, service providers benefit service consumers. Service is intangible in nature. Services may be defined as acts or performances whereby the service provider provides value to the customer.
          In a narrower sense, service refers to quality of customer service: the measured appropriateness of assistance and support provided to a customer. 
          This particular usage occurs frequently in retailing.</p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Products</h4>
        <p>In marketing, a product is an object, or system, or service made available for consumer use as of the consumer demand; it is anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy the desire or need of a customer.[
          
          1] In retailing, products are often referred to as merchandise, and in manufacturing, products are bought as raw materials and then sold as finished goods. A service is also regarded as a type of product.

          Commodities are usually raw materials such as metals and agricultural products, but a commodity can also be anything widely available in the open market. In project management, 
          
          products are the formal definition of the project deliverables that make up or contribute to delivering the objectives of the project.
          
          A related concept is that of a sub-product, a secondary but useful result of a production process.
          
          Dangerous products, particularly physical ones, that cause injuries to consumers or bystanders may be subject to product liability.</p>
